## Overview

This document explains how data is handled for **Invio**, including both the **self-hosted app** and the **website** at [https://invio.dev](https://invio.dev).

---

## The Invio App

The **Invio App** is fully self-hosted.  
It does **not** collect, transmit, or store any data outside of your own environment.

- No telemetry  
- No analytics  
- No external requests for tracking or data collection  

Any data processed by the app remains on your own server or device.

---

## The Invio Website (https://invio.dev)

The **website** uses **[Umami Analytics](https://umami.is)** to collect basic, anonymous usage information.  
This helps understand how the site is used (for example, which pages are visited most often).

### What’s collected
Umami records anonymized information such as:
- Pages visited  
- Referring sources  
- General device and browser type  

It does **not** collect personally identifiable information such as IP addresses, names, or email addresses.

### How data is used
The data is used only to get an overview of website usage and improve the site over time.  
No data is sold or shared by Invio.  
Umami’s own data handling policies may apply — see their documentation at [umami.is](https://umami.is) for details.
